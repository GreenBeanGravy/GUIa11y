# FortniteA11y
A tool that tries to add extra accessibility to the online game Fortnite for individuals who are blind or visually impaired. Currently, the tool does not function in game. This repository is currently here to allow me to push changes as they come out. This page will be properly updated in the future as I work towards the first release. If you end up reading this before I remove it in the first release, make sure to Watch this repository and Star it! This is a big project and you won't want to miss it.

Currently, you can navigate the tkinter GUI window (though it's opacity is set to 0.01 so it is practically invisible) using the arrow keys. The left and right arrow keys change between sections, and the up and down arrow keys change between the elements within those sections. An editor is provided that allows speedy editing of the config.json file, though it is not accessible yet. The config.json file can also be edited manually. The script outputs to NVDA but also works even if no screen reader is open.
